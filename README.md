# Manipulation 

## Context
- The data is about NBA (National Basketball Association) games from 2004 season to Dec, 2020.
- We'll be focusing on practicing importing data and data manipulation techniques.
- Made minor changes on the data, such as changing the column names. Check out the original source if you are interested in using this data for other purposes (https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games)

## Dataset Description:

We'll work on two datasets (in two separate csv files):

  - **games**: each game from 2004 season to Dec 2020, including information about the two teams in each game, and some details like number of points, etc
  - **teams**: information about each team played in the games
  
We want to study the game level data, but with detailed information about each team. Then we'll need to combine these two datasets together.

## Objective: 
   - Load/examine/subset/rename/change dtypes of columns for each individual dataset
   - Combine them into a single dataset, and export it
   - Explore the final dataset by subsetting or sorting
